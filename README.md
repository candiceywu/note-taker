## Description
This application, Team Profile Generator, allows the user to create a webpage that captures their team information for the manager, engineer(s) and intern(s). The application will prompt the user with questions that they can answer in detail, which will then populate an index.html file under the /dist folder, and they can open this in their browser to see the formatted results. This helps the user visualize their team and they can also click the email links for the manager, engineer(s) intern to email them directly, as well as click on the engineer's GitHub username to take them to their GitHub profile page.

## Installation
For installation, the user will use their command line (Terminal, Bash, etc.) and make sure they are accessing the correct server.js file that's being run. The user can then type in 'node server.js' or 'node server' in the command line. The command line will then return 'App listening at http://localhost:3001'. But for this homework's requirements, the application has been deployed through Heroku, so please access the application [here](https://fierce-lowlands-57764.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage 
The application helps the user keep track of their notes; the user can type in a title, followed by text; when the user is done, they can click the 'save' icon at the top right corner, which will log the notes to the left-hand column of the application page. The user can also click on that saved note to bring it to full preview on the right-hand column, as well as delete it by clicking the 'delete' (trash) icon.
